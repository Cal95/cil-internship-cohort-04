# Based on known growth strategies, how would you improve the market penetration of a digital product you use everyday?

# Some of the strategies I can apply to improve the penetration of a digital product are:

1. Change the pricing:
Lower or raise the cost of the products or features.

2. Revamp the marketing:
Rework your marketing plan and/or roadmap.

3. Identify the need for a new product and launch it:
Survey and analyze your customers and target audience to identify the need for a new product or feature. Then, create that product and sell it.

4. Update or change the product or a specific feature of your product:
Resolve the challenges of your customers and buyer personas more effectively by updating or changing a product or feature.

5. Grow business in new territories and offer franchise opportunities:
Identify new territories in which you can expand and grow your business. Ask yourself: Which new areas can we open our stores or prospect? You might also begin offering franchise opportunities to expand your brick-and-mortar business.

6. Identify a business partner to work with:
Partner or merge with another business in a mutually beneficial way (e.g. run a co-marketing campaign).
